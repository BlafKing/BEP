#Reasoning

Hi all, unfortunately I can no longer keep hosting this bot.

I can no longer afford hosting this bot for multiple reasons:

Primarely, it's caused by Discord, I used to host this bot exclusively on a Discord server called LuckStruck9, however I used a `user discord bot` to update the messages.
Later on I found out making and using a user bot is not allowed by Discord's TOS and my main account got permanently banned for this.

There are 2 types of bans on discord,

`
Account Termination: The user's account gets disabled and then deleted later. They are allowed to make a new account.

Permanent Ban: The user is permanently banned from Discord. If the user had a phone number added to their account, their phone number is blacklisted from being used on any other account and a phone verification will be set on the user's IP address. They are not allowed to use Discord again.
```

I accepted the consequences of my actions, and made a new account.
However about 2 weeks later, Discord has suddenly decided to resort to IP banning my router, and banning every account I try to create.
