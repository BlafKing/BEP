# Reasoning

Hi all, unfortunately I can no longer keep hosting this bot for multiple reasons:

Primarely, it's caused by Discord, I used to host this bot exclusively on a Discord server called LuckStruck9, however at first I used a `user discord bot` to update the messages.
Later on I found out making and using a user bot is not allowed by Discord's TOS and my main account got permanently banned for this.

There are 2 types of bans on discord:

```
Account Termination: The user's account gets disabled and then deleted later. They are allowed to make a new account.

Permanent Ban: The user is permanently banned from Discord. If the user had a phone number added to their account, their phone number is blacklisted from being used on any other account and a phone verification will be set on the user's IP address. They are not allowed to use Discord again.
```

I never received any email by Discord stating anything about my account being banned, I didn't know why/how/when my account was banned, I could only guess.

I assumed I received an account termination, since again, I had to guess. This meant I had to create a new Discord BOT and lose all my conversations on the old account.

After this happened I tried contacting Discord multiple times about the issue, but each time I just received an automated email stating "the account would not be re-instated" without being given any reasoning, I have never been able to speak to a human every time I attempted to contact them.

After creating a new account, all was well for about 2 weeks, until suddenly, that account has now gotten banned as well.

It looks like I am now permanently banned since everytime I create a new account, I have to verify my phone and once I do, I get instantly banned on the new account.

Because of this, I am now  unable to give bot updates on discord, since I am completely unable to access the platform, it's crazy how trying to help a community results in me being permanently banned from Discord.

Furthermore, hosting this bot is also not financially stable for me, I lose way more money to electricity than I get back in donations.

I sincerely appreciate every single person that has donated while this bot was up, you guys really kept the dream alive but unfortunately Discord has put the nail in the coffin.

Thanks for understanding everyone, and let's hope someone else starts hosting this bot again!
